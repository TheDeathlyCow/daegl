# The Mines of Daegl FAQ

Q: What is Daegl?

A: Daegl is a Dwarven-themed PvE dungeon that allows you to renewably obtain copper, iron, gold, as well as other rewards. 


Q: How long will the event be on the server?

A: The rest of the season! 


Q: How many times can I run the dungeon?

A: You can run the dungeon once every 12 hours. A 'run' is only counted when you defeat the boss.


Q: If I die and lose my items, can I get them back?

A: You will get your items, xp, and enderchest restored if you or anyone in your party leave before defeating the boss. 


Q: What items should I bring?

A: Weapons, armour, food, potions, totems, but NOT TOOLS. They'll just waste space in your inventory. You'll be given a pickaxe. Diamonds will also be useful for the Miners Brew merchant. 


Q: I can't break any blocks??

A: Use the Miner's Pickaxe. It's an iron pick in your inventory. 


Q: What are these random amethyst cyrstals?

A: Those are **Glow Crystals**. Use them in the upgrades shop in the start area! 


Q: Can I bring an ender chest/shulker box? 

A: You cannot place blocks in Daegl. An Ender Chest is provided, so you don't need to bring that. Shulker boxes can be swapped with the Shulker Swapper.

Q: What rewards can I get?

A: In addition to loads of copper, iron, and gold, you can also get a handful of diamonds; **Miner's Brew**, a haste potion that is potent enough to allow you to instamine deepslate; Allay spawn eggs (until 1.19.1, when this will be irrelevant); and the **Firestone Pickaxe**, which is capable of auto smelting ores.

Q: I got stuck somewhere, help!! 

A:  Use the command `/trigger iamstuck`. Then, **give me the coordinates** and I'll fix it at a later date.


Q: Does fortune work on iron?

A: Not normally, BUT your Miners Pickaxe in Daegl *can* fortune iron if you have the upgrade.
